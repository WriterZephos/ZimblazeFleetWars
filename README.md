# ZimblazeFleetWars
A very crude 2D space simulation game.

## Introduction

This is a little side project I made in college using Java, trying to learn how to program game loops, etc. It actually required a lot of trigonomety to calculate the right tragectories for the bullets, paths for the space ships, and the sizes of the hit boxes for collision detection.

You can see a lot of those calculations here: https://github.com/WriterZephos/ZimblazeFleetWars/blob/master/src/graphics/VectorTools.java

The game allowed you to select a ship, and click a point to make it fly there, or click another ship to make it shoot a bomb or laser. Pretty silly, but it was fun!

You can download the app [here](https://github.com/WriterZephos/ZimblazeFleetWars/raw/master/ZimblazeFleetWars.jar) (Java executable).
